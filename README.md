# Rename files
Rename files with Jupyter Notebook.
I may want to change or need to change a large number of file name once every few months or years. I used to use favorite renaming tool. But it hasn't been update for a long time. The request to change the file name varies depending on the situation, so I decided to leave my knowledge in a Jupyter Notebook that can respond flexibly.
